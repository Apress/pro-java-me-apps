Hi!

There are two NetBeans project folders here. One is for the main Twitter client, the other is for a project containing code samples for the rest of the book.

When working with the Twitter client project, make sure you set the right access tokens in TweetsController.java and in WelcomeForm.java. Instructions on how to do this are given in the book in Chapter 8. For convenience, all relevant tokens have been replaced with "xxxx" so that you may easily find them using a global search.

Happy coding,
Ovidiu
